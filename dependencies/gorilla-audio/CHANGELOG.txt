CHANGE LOG
---

0.3.0
- All documentation written, at least in provisional form (GAU still needs more
  detail).
- Windows builds now only enable the OpenAL device by default. You can set
  ENABLE_XAUDIO2 in cmake-gui to enable XAudio2 devices.
- gau_manager_create() now takes 0 parameters. To customize the gau_Manager
  settings, please use gau_manager_create_custom().
- Various other small changes to the interface.

0.2.9
- Added minimal Doxygen comments to the Gorilla Common API (GAU is still forthcoming).
- Updated Linux and OSX ports to work correctly with latest changes.

0.2.8
- Created logo.
- Added copious Doxygen comments to the Gorilla Audio API (GAU/GC are still forthcoming).
- Moved device headers into gorilla/devices.
- Moved various internal functions, definitions, and data structures into ga_internal.h
  header.

0.2.7
- Implemented XAudio2 device support for Windows.

0.2.6
- Implemented ga_Memory data structure for refcounting shared memory.
- Stubbed in XAudio2 support.
- Added gau_sample_source_loop_count() function to count how many times something
  has looped. This is a stop-gap feature, to be deprecated after planned looping 
  improvements.

0.2.5
- You can now query the gau_Manager for its device.

0.2.4
- Moved device initialization into gau_Manager.
- Removed loopStart and loopEnd parameters from gau_helper_*.
- Stubbed in DirectSound support in CMake project files.
- Removed vestigial streamLink handle property.

  handling WAV files with extension chunks.

0.2.2
- First properly-versioned release.
- Fixed deadlock in archive data source.
- Replaced an accidental naked malloc with internal allocFunc.
- Fixed a bug in looping logic.
